# Changelog

## Release 0.0.2

- Adding model architectures: EquiformerV2, UMA
- Providing tools for downloading, decompressing, splitting, merging and converting
  LMDB and ExtXYZ datasets to HDF5 datasets, and removing ExtXYZ dataset support
- Making HDF5 format to be compatible with the format used by MACE library
- Supporting input of dataset directory, parallel loading, and automatic train/val/test
  splitting

## Release 0.0.1

- Adding model architectures: LiTEN
- Changing the repository name and reorganizing the code structure
- Migrating from flax.linen to flax.nnx
- Renaming function or class: MlipNetwork -> ForceModel, parse_activation -> 
  get_activation_fn, RadialEmbeddingBlock -> RadialEmbeddingLayer, etc.
- Deleting ASE simulation backend
- Deleting `swish` activation (equal to `silu`)
- Changing the model file format from `.zip` to `.safetensors`
- Fixing a bug caused by the new version of jax not supporting the conversion of None
  to Array

## Release 0.1.3 (MLIP)

- Adding two new options to the MACE implementation, a more complex species embedding
  and a gating mechanism for node features. Making use of these options may improve
  inference speed at similar accuracy.
- Fixing a bug that caused overriding energy and forces predictions to be "None" when
  stress is computed by a model.

## Release 0.1.2 (MLIP)

- Fixing the computation of metrics during training, by reweighting the metrics of
  each batch to account for a varying number of real graphs per batch; this results
  in the metrics being independent of the batching strategy and number of GPUs employed
- In addition to the point above, fixing the computation of RMSE metrics by now
  only computing MSE metrics in the loss and taking the square root at the very end
  when logging
- Deleting relative and 95-percentile metrics, as they are not straightforward to
  compute on-the-fly with our dynamic batching strategy; we recommend to compute them
  separately for a model checkpoint if necessary
- Small amount of modifications to README and documentation

## Release 0.1.1 (MLIP)

- Small amount of modifications to README and documentation
- Adding link to white paper in README

## Release 0.1.0 (MLIP)

- Implemented model architectures: MACE, NequIP and ViSNet
- Dataset preprocessing
- Training of MLIP models
- Batched inference with trained MLIP models
- MD simulations with MLIP models using JAX-MD and ASE simulation backends
- Energy minimizations with MLIP models using the same simulation backends
- Fine-tuning of pre-trained MLIP models (only for MACE)
