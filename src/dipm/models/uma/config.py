class UMAConfig(BaseModel):
    """The configuration / hyperparameters of the UMA model.

    Attributes:
        num_layers: Number of UMA layers. Default is 12.
        lmax: Maximum degree of the spherical harmonics (1 to 10).
        mmax: Maximum order of the spherical harmonics (0 to lmax).
        sphere_channels: Number of spherical channels. Default is 128.
        edge_channels: Number of channels for the edge invariant features. Default is 128.
        hidden_channels: Number of hidden channels in the UMA layer. Default is 128.
        num_rbf: Number of basis functions used in the embedding block. Default is 600.
        grid_resolution: Resolution of SO3Grid used in Activation. Examples are 18, 16, 14, None
                         (default, decided automatically).
        norm_type: Type of normalization layer. Options are "layer_norm", "layer_norm_sh" (default)
                   and "rms_norm_sh".
        act_type: Type of activation function. Options are "gate" (default) and "s2_sep".
        ff_type: Type of feed-forward function. Options are "spectral" (default) and "grid".
        atomic_energies: How to treat the atomic energies. If set to ``None`` (default) or the
                         string ``"average"``, then the average atomic energies stored in the
                         dataset info are used. It can also be set to the string ``"zero"`` which
                         means not to use any atomic energies in the model. Lastly, one can also
                         pass an atomic energies dictionary via this parameter different from the
                         one in the dataset info, that is used.
        dataset_list: List of different datasets used in training. Every dataset will have a
                      different embedding. `None` means no dataset embedding.
        num_species: The number of elements (atomic species descriptors) allowed. If ``None``
                     (default), infer the value from the atomic energies map in the dataset info.
        num_experts: Number of experts in the MoLE block. Default is 8.
        mole_dropout: Dropout rate for MoLE router. Default is 0.0.
        use_composition_embedding: Whether to use composition embedding in MoLE router.
