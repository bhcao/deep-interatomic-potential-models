class JaxMDSimulationConfig(pydantic.BaseModel):
    """Configuration for the JAX-MD-based simulations.

    The config is separated into three blocks: values that
    are used for both MD and minimization, and then the ones used exclusively for MD
    and for minimization, respectively.

    Attributes:
        simulation_type: The type of simulation to run, either MD or minimization.
                    Defaults to MD.
        num_steps: The number of total steps to run. For energy minimizations,
                   this is the maximum number of steps if no convergence reached
                   earlier.
        snapshot_interval: The interval (in steps) between snapshots of the simulation
                           state. This means information about every N-th
                           snapshot is stored in the simulation state available to the
                           loggers (N being the snapshot interval). Defaults to 1.
        box: The simulation box. If ``None``, no periodic boundary conditions are
             applied (this is the default). It can be set to either a float or a list
             of three floats, describing the dimensions of the box.
        edge_capacity_multiplier: Factor to multiply the number of edges by to
                                  obtain the edge capacity including padding. Defaults
                                  to 1.25.
        num_episodes: Number of episodes to divide the simulation into. Each episode
                      runs in a fully jitted way, and the loggers are only
                      called after each episode. If not set, an appropriate value will
                      be attempted to be select but it is possible that it may have to
                      be manually set. For fewer than 1000 steps, ``num_episodes`` will
                      be set so that the number of steps per episode will be 10. For
                      more than 1000 steps, ``num_episodes`` will be set so that the
                      number of steps per episode will be 1000. Therefore, if
                      ``num_episodes`` is not set, it requires that ``num_steps`` be
                      divisible by 1000 if greater than 1000 otherwise divisible by 10.
        timestep_fs: The simulation timestep in femtoseconds. This is also used as the
                     initial timestep in the FIRE minimization algorithm. The default is
                     1.0.
        temperature_kelvin: The temperature in Kelvin, set to 300 by default. Must be
                            set to ``None`` for energy minimizations.
        temperature_schedule_config: The temperature schedule config to use for the
                                 simulation. Default is the constant schedule in
                                 which case ``temperature_kelvin`` will be applied.
